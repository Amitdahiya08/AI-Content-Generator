## Overview

The AI Content Generator is a web application designed to create various types of content using OpenAI's GPT-3 API. This app allows users to generate content with ease, leveraging the power of AI to create text for different purposes.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js (if applicable)
- **API:** OpenAI GPT-3
- **Environment Variables:** dotenv for managing API keys

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the AI Content Generator app:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
- An OpenAI API key. You can obtain this by signing up on the [OpenAI website](https://www.openai.com/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-content-generator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd ai-content-generator
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the root of the project directory.

2. **Add your API key** to the `.env` file with the following format:

   ```env
   REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

   Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with the actual API key you obtained from OpenAI.

### Usage

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to generate content using the AI.

### Important Notes

- Ensure you keep your API key confidential and do not expose it in public repositories.
- For production deployments, consider using more secure methods for managing environment variables.

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with API requests, double-check your API key and ensure it is correctly placed in the `.env` file.
- Verify that all dependencies are installed and the development server is running properly.
